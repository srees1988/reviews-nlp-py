# reviews-nlp-py
This Yelp user reviews dataset is a subset that focuses on Domino's franchises in the US. It's ideal for those interested in exploring Topic Modelling, Sentiment Analysis, Keyword Extraction, and Summarization. You can utilize the Python code available on my GitHub page to examine this dataset and discover significant findings regarding customer preferences, pain points, and other relevant information. Additionally, I have composed a step-by-step guide (available on my Medium blog) that will assist you in uncovering insights from unstructured data points in this dataset. I encourage you to take a look and explore the possibilities.
